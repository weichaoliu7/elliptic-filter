# 7th-Order Low-Pass Elliptic Filter Simulation

## Description

This program simulates a 7th-order low-pass elliptic filter for a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) system. It calculates the transfer function of the filter and generates Bode plot data, including magnitude and phase response.

## File

- `main.c`: The C source code file for simulating the filter and generating Bode plot data.
